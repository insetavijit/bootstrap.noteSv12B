# **How to Approach : Accordion (FAQ Pattern)**

> **Senior Developer Guidance:**  
> Accordions structure information **hierarchically**, revealing details progressively rather than overwhelming users upfront. Use accordions to organize repetitive question–answer content, segmented details, or nested structures. Focus on clarity, accessibility, and smooth interaction flow rather than animation effects.

Bootstrap’s Accordion component provides a flexible collapse-based interface pattern that enables organized content expansion controlled by headers. It supports single-open or multi-open behavior, event triggers, and utility-based customization. Accordions enhance readability and reduce cognitive load in documentation systems, dashboards, knowledge bases, and mobile UI layouts.

Prioritize semantic markup, ARIA roles, keyboard navigation, and scroll management for production-quality FAQ experiences.
