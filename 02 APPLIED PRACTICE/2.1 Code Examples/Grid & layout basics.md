# **How to Approach : Grid & Layout**

> **Senior Developer Guidance:**  
> Establish structural integrity before addressing visual design. Approach layout methodically: define the **container** to set boundaries, use **rows** to organize horizontal content flow, and apply **columns** to manage responsive distribution across breakpoints. Treat layout engineering as a layered decision process rather than a styling exercise.

The Bootstrap Grid system forms the foundation of responsive UI development, delivering flexible, mobile-first layouts built on CSS Flexbox. By combining containers, rows, and columns with breakpoint-based scaling, the grid intelligently adapts interfaces across screen sizes and device types. Mastering grid behavior develops the structural intuition required to architect scalable, maintainable, and component-driven user interfaces — from landing pages to dashboards and enterprise web applications.
