## Overview - Easy Language
Bootstrap containers are the **outer boxes** that hold your website content. They decide **how wide your content can be**, add **side spacing**, and keep everything **centered on the screen**. Containers do not arrange content themselves; they only create a **safe boundary** where the layout system can work properly.
